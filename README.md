A large-scale project undertaken to provide a desktop app for an old high school -- Project was discontinued due to moving to a new place

The project is based on Java and JavaFX. The functionality, back-End and Front-End were both produced by Zeeshan Khan. 
Inspiration was taken by reading an array of different projects before creating this. 

This is the desktop version of the application -- It includes everything, including scraping data from the web (with school permission) and many amazing functionalities. It is the full Package. 

** Please note that it might not be perfect as it was written when I was 15, however, it is functional

If you wish to use anything, please add my name to it and I will be glad to be of some help to you like many others have been to me.
